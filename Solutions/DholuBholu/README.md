# Description of Solution
<strong>
Emergencies can be created at any point in our lives, and as the technology is advancing at a tremendous pace, the only thing that can make emergency facilities available at our tips is when we integrate it with technology!<br><br>
To solve this problem, we came up with an idea of making an application which can connect hospitals and the patients without any kind of resistance. We’ve created MedHub which can help the patient to book appointments for various medical facilities like checking vaccine availabilities, organs (eye, kidney, liver, etc.) donation, blood donation and others. This does not only save the patient’s time but also is extremely helpful during emergency times. We even provide the facility to choose the doctor as per your convenience.<br><br>
Integration of health and technology can make our lives easier and safer. This is one of the steps towards that integration. MedHub can ensure the trust between the doctor and the patient even before the appointment as the users are allowed to rate them! Now get your treatment done from the best ones in your area!!
Thank You!
